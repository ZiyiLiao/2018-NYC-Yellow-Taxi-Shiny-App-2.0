### Data folder

The data directory contains data used in the analysis. This is treated as read only; in paricular the R/python files are never allowed to write to the files in here. Depending on the project, these might be csv files, a database, and the directory itself may have subdirectories.

Here, we have **Taxi Zone Shape Data** from NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) and the **2018 Yellow Taxi Trip Data** (Raw) given by NYC Open data. Enclosed are the URLs for the data:

1. https://www1.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page (already in this folder)
2. https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Transportation/2018-Yellow-Taxi-Trip-Data/t29m-gskq (large csv file, cannot be uploaded to Github, linked provided here)
